# StudyBuddy

## Dependencies

This gem is pretty much tailored to my workflow.  Look for more customization options in the future.

1. colordiff
2. vim

## Installation

Currently, this github repo is the only place to get this gem.  
    
    git clone https://github.com/rjg/study_buddy
    cd study_buddy
    gem build study_buddy.gemspec
    rake install

## Usage

More to come on this later...

## Contributing

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request

## TODO:

1. Have it remember what the last settings were so when I want to just make a new test, I can just do "study_buddy make"
2. Handle the question number thing (e.g. when I try to do a test with more questions than lines)
